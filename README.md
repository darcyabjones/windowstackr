# `windowstackr`

windowstackr provides a desktop window like interface for shiny apps.
Basically, you have a grid which you can add and remove windows to.
You can drag the windows around to reorganise whatever shiny widgets you have in there.


## Why on earth would you want that?

Well... I have complex datasets with multiple visualisations and tables that i want to be able to mix and match.
I also want to be able to share it with co-workers and have them be able to add and remove windows, and drag things next to each other.



## Alternatives

If you just want the grid + drag thing, you should check out [gridstackr](https://github.com/dreamRs/gridstackr).
This project initially used gridstackr until started needing more custom javascript and callbacks.

If you don't want a grid and just need a 1D orderable list, check out [sortable](https://rstudio.github.io/sortable/).
